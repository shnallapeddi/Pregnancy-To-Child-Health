Topic of Project: Leveraging health data to predict infant survival and wellbeing from pregnancy to early childhood.

Note: To distinguish between phases 1, 2, and 3, we have renamed the files accordingly. Additionally, the data cleaning process has been improved in Phase 2 for increased accuracy & better dataset. The file titled "Raw_Data_Updated" is our initial dataset which is used across all the phases. In Phase 1, we individually performed EDA using the "feature_engineering" CSV and XLS files.
