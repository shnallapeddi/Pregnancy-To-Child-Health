Topic of Project: Leveraging health data to predict infant survival and wellbeing from pregnancy to early childhood.

Note: To distinguish between phases 1, 2, and 3, we have renamed the files accordingly. The file titled "Raw_Data_Updated" is our initial dataset which is used across all the phases. 

Phase 1:
Main File: Main_phase1.ipynb
We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) separately using the "feature_engineering" CSV and XLS files. These files represent the Excel sheet created after all data cleaning steps were completed.

Phase 2:
The data cleaning process was refined in Phase 2 to enhance accuracy and improve the dataset quality.
The file cleaned_dataset_rounded_off.csv is used as the input for data loading.
Individual .ipynb files labeled with "phase2" have been uploaded.
